DWH PROFESSIONAL FUNDAS:

Data: 
	Anything you are able to store.
	Raw artifact from business or non business.

Data Availability Types

a) Structured Data : OLTP applications data
b) Semi-Structured Data : Logs, Journals, Event Hubs etc...
c) Unstructured Data:Social media data (facebook, twitter, gmail etc...) and documents data(word, pdf etc...)

Data Stoage availability

a) File System storage--Data in the form of files [Preferred for few structured, and more semi and unstructured data]

b) Database storage--Data in the form of databases [Structured data storage]

Datawarehouse
--Huge data storage area

Huge data storage areas

a) Structured data storage--Datawarehouse [ Teradata, Oracle, Sql Server etc...]

b) Blob storage --Azure [more volumes of data such as files, images, videos etc...]

c) Data Lake --Azure [Structured, Semi Structured, and Unstructured Storage area]


Differences between OLTP Systems and OLAP Systems

BI Process

GENERAL PUBLIC-->OLTP-->ODS-->STAGE-->DWH-->CUBES-->REPORTING--> DECISION MAKING PEOPLE
                              (250)   (250)    (190)       45   Tables

OLTP: Current data or fresh or "real time" data storage area
ODS: Operational Data Store 
         Which stores "near real-time data "
         Ex: Daily 3 times loading data from OLTP to intermediate ODS.
      
        ODS acts like input to DW, so that no burden on OLTP systems.

Stage: One more intermediate area to store and perform operations [ transformations and partly incremental data load]

DWH: Huge "incremental data" storage area



DWH principles or characterstics

 --Many scientists, Authors, Practioneries and others defined many principles.
-- Bill Inmon principles [ Father of Data Warehouse]

    a) Subject Oriented Data [Savings, Current, DMAT etc...]
    b) Integrated data [Ensuring common standard of data Ex: common currency, common naming convention etc...]
    c) Time varient [data based on time frames, so that "current understanding", "past analysis", and "future prediction" is easier]
    d) Non-Volatile [No change of data, so that history you can maintain

Note: Time varient require proper granularity

Granularity:

The level of detailed data storing in the warehouse.

Ex: Day wise, week wise, month wise etc...

Trainer's company: 

DWH has multiple tables and multiple grains, but low grain is day.

If you store data in day wise: Day, week, month, quarter etc... analysis is easier.

Life cycle:

Each project require life cycle. Our DWH project has multiple layers and tools, so multiple life cycles used.
Steps remain same.

1.Requirements gathering
2. Analysis
3. Design
4. Coding
5. Testing
6. Implementation or Deployment
7. Maintenance or Support [ SLA--Service Level Agreement]

a) ETL life cycle 
b) Semantic life cycle
c) Reporting life cycle

OLAP:

Online analytical processing

Many types of OLAP available.

a) ROLAP: Relational OLAP
	 Data and aggregates in relational format.

b) MOLAP: Multidimensional OLAP

	Data and aggregates in multidimensional format [ in cubes]

c) HOLAP : Hybrid OLAP
	
	Data in relational format and aggregates in multidimensional format [in cubes]
	
d) DOLAP : Desktop OLAP
	Data and aggregates in desktop applications
	Analysing in the excel or lotus etc.. desktop applications


Data Mart:

Data specific subject area / functionality area / task area.

Ex: Current account processing is a subject area / data mart area

May be depend on ware house or independent from ware house.

It is of two major types

a) Dependent Data Mart:

	First warehouse created and the data marts defined from ware house.
	Simply, data mart is subset of datawarehouse.

b) Independent Data Mart:

	From oltp / transactional systems, we construct data marts directly.
	Simply, data mart is independent from the ware house.


DWH approaches:

Each project contains one life cycle (Ex: Agile ) and one approach.

a) KIMBALL approach: Data marts created and then ware house generated. [ Bottom Up approach]
b) INMON approach: Datawarehouse created and then data marts generated. [ Top Down approach]

Note: Most of the projects using KIMBAL approach because of cost, resource and process effectiveness.


Hierarchy:

Contain multiple levels and members.
Minimum two levels required.

Date hierarchy: 

Centuary--> Decade-->Quadyear-->Year-->Semister-->Quarter-->Month-->Fortnight-->Week-->Day

Time Hierarchy:

Hour--> Minutes-->Seconds-->MilliSeconds



What exactly a DWH project require for better decision support?

a) DWH Principles [Bill Inmon]
b) DWH Approach [KIMBALL]
c) One Life Cycle [Agile methodology]

Note: 
Agile methodology [Agile SDLC]
--Agility means changing [ quick and fast]
--Team members [5-8]
--Work in the form of sprints [ 1 week- 6 weeks sprint]
--Cross functional teams 
  [Here you will gather requirements, analyze it, design it, code it, test it and publish it]
--Meetings [ Daily scrum meeting for 15 minutes { standup meeting}]
--Team contain Scrum member, Scrum Master, Hive, Pig, Chicken etc... roles...

Data Modelling Fundas

Assume you have identified a proper DWH approach, Life Cycle, and Principles.
The left over is Model for the ware house.

Most of the projects using Dimensional Modeling with the below dimensional model schemas
a) Star Schema
b) Snow flake schema
c) Hybrid schema
d) Galaxy Schema / Fact Constellation Schema

Schema: Relationship between dimension and fact tables.

Dimension Table: Textual table, contains only textual information..
Ex: Student dimension table contain students data
     Location dimension table contains location data
   etc...

Fact table: Contains dimension references followed by business measures.
Ex: Student, location and their tution fee {business measure}.

Star Schema:

Fact table surrounded by dimensions

Snow flake schema:

Fact table surrounded by dimensions and dimensions having sub dimensions {dimensional hierarchy}.

Mixed Schema:

Star + Snow flake


Galaxy schema:  

Multiple fact tables sharing common dimension tables and appear like galaxy.
